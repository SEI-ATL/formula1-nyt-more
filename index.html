    <!-- Maybe I clicked something wrong, but I went to get the NYT api..
    got the verification email sent to me. Clicked on the email to verify the account.
I got the: "OOPS SOMETHING WENT AMISS" error message.
I clicked back and tried to verify the account again and it said my account was verified already.
I couldn't get another link sent out and as I looked through my account on NYT I couldn't see any kind of API key. -->
